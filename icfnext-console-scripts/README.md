The groovy scripts on this page were tested in the [ICF Next Groovy Console](https://github.com/icfnext/aem-groovy-console).

- [find-missing-assets.groovy](find-missing-assets.groovy) - this script iterates the items in the filter of a workflow package and outputs the assets or pages that cannot be found in the JCR.
- [fix-property-using-query.groovy](fix-property-using-query.groovy) - Uses a JCR query to find a node (asset) and then changes the property on a granchild node. A good example of query execution.
